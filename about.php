            This application was made,from Michalis Zeakis,Stathis Tsitsopoulos,Kaparounakis Giwrgos,Xrhstos Katsaros, for movie fans. We are 23 years old, and we all study electrical and computer engineering at the university of Thessaly. We hope that this application will help in the forming of a movie-fan community where everybody gets to say their opinion for every movie.
